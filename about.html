            <p class="content-text">I'm a UX/UI Designer and self-taught Front-end Developer apprentice based in Amsterdam.
            I love translating ideas into something tangible but mostly, I like having fun during the ride, that‚Äôs my whole purpose.
            I've been having the most exciting time in The Netherlands getting to know the culture, the people and the beautiful places.
            <br><br>
            I was proudly part of the 3D printing company, <a class="ultimaker" href="https://ultimaker.com/" target="_blank">Ultimaker</a> for a couple               of years as a UX/UI Designer of the website and also responsible for creating the end-to-end flow and visuals of the Subscription Portal. I'm             currently working at <a class="rabobank" href="https://www.rabobank.nl/particulieren" target="_blank">Rabobank</a> as a Senior UX Designer in the             Business Lending Tribe building financial applications to Business Analysts sharpening their experience with their clients.</p>

            <p class="content-text">I lived in Sao Paulo for 7 years and worked closely with some of the most remarkable people in great places such as Ogilvy, Maria Sao Paulo and E/OU MRM (McCann Group) doing countless jobs that contributed greatly to my learning process and shaped me into the Designer I am today. <br><br> 
            I'm constantly willing to learn something new. And I love people who are not afraid to be daring, to do new things and to share new ideas with the world. That's why I decided to learn to code. To add more value to my work and expand my knowledge but mainly, to bridge the gap between designers and developers. <br><br>
            Not only do I believe that designers should always seek knowledge beyond their expertise, but I also believe that design and code can no longer exist apart from each other.<br>

        <h1 class="content-title">Values I carry with me:</h1>
        <p class="content-text">
        <strong>üíñ  Passion:</strong> One of the most important feelings in life. Without passion we don't grow, we do no good for us or for others. If you don't like what you're doing: move. I'm very fortunate to find passion for what I do, but it wasn't always like that. I had to seek and dig into myself a lot to find what my passion was, but it was all worth living. <br><br>
        <strong>ü§ì  Learning is timeless:</strong> Indeed. And the more we learn, the more we grow. I'm always looking for different ways to keep challenging myself and increase my knowledge with not only things work-related. <br><br>
        <strong>ü§©  Nurture your creativity:</strong> Yes, big time! Everybody needs to embrace all kinds of inputs that triggers our creativity. That's why when I'm not working, I'm biking, traveling, jogging, reading about astrology or serial killers, watching good movies or binging great TV series and so on. <br><br>
        <strong>üôè  Keep humble:</strong> Whether you're CEO of a huge company or an intern just starting, you're no better than anyone else and you know nothing about other people's struggles. We should always respect one another, no matter what position we are. Stay true and honest to yourself. <br><br>
